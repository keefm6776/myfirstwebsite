# My first Webpage

Welcome!

## This Project

This project has been my first website, from start to finish, which shows the technologies that I have come across doing my full stack developers course with Code Institute.
It has allowed me to put into practice concepts that I have learnt in the first two modules mainly HTML 5 and CSS 3.  The purpose has been to put these ideas into practice and to link
to other websites to describe the technologies that I have and will be using in this course.  I am currently working on learning about Cloud 9, Git and GitHub as we speak.

### Technologies used

During this project I have used:

HTML5   - This provides the structure to my webpage, allowing me to link to other websites for information and logos to use for links

CSS 3   - This has allows me to add style and a better all round look to this website.

CLOUD 9 - Cloud 9 has been my editor to work and organise my code files.  It has also allowed me to try my website out before committing it to Git Hub.

Git     - This has allowed me to locally lodge my files away and keep track of the changes that I have made.

GitHub  - This has provided me with a remote storage location to store and host my first webpage.
